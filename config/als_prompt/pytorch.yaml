    Please analyze the coverage result of this PyTorch code which executes on Eager and Inductor compiler. Help me summarize the coverage result in three short sentences.
    The **Next testing strategy** should give some suggestions on how to improve the coverage.
    ### Result Analysis
    1. **Explanation**: This model triggers new coverage when executed on Eager and Inductor compiler.
    2. **Reasons**: Operator fusion of Linear and ReLu is triggered by the Torch Inductor compiler, leading to new coverage. Additionally, Use a new operator logo_softmax which maybe not appear in the previous test cases.
    3. **Next Testing Strategy**: Consider another optimization of PyTorch Inductor: operator fusion of Conv2d-BatchNorm2d-ReLu.

    The **Next testing strategy** should give some suggestions on how to improve the coverage.
    ### Result Analysis
    1. **Explanation**: This model does not trigger new coverage when executed on eager and Inductor compiler.
    2. **Reasons**: The model uses common operators such as Conv2d, BatchNorm2d, ReLU, and MaxPool2d, which are already covered by existing test cases. The input tensor shape (1, 3, 256, 256) is typical for image processing tasks and does not push the boundaries of existing coverage.
    3. **Next Testing Strategy**: Use ConvTranspose2d-GroupNorm-ReLU to trigger fusion and use unusual input shapes to explore untested code paths.

    ### Bug Symptom:
    results with Torch Inductor compiler:
    RuntimeError: result type Float can't be cast to the desired output type Long


    Analyze whether this is an invalid model caused by the code itself or a potential bug in the PyTorch. Help me summarize the symptoms of this bug in three short sentences.
    If it is an invalid model, **Next Testing Strategy** should provide the solution to fix the model. If it is a potential bug, **Next Testing Strategy** should provide the strategy to trigger more similar bugs.
    ### Result Analysis
    1. **Explanation**: This is a potential bug in PyTorch Inductor Compiler.
    2. **Reasons**: The compiler fails to handle type promotion during operations such as dropout, causing a mismatch between input and output tensor types.
    3. **Next Testing Strategy**: Use tensor inputs which involve different dtypes (e.g., int8, int16, int64)

    ### Bug Symptom:
    The code is invalid
    The code throws exceptions during execution in both eager mode and compiler mode.
    The exception in eager mode is
    RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (2x10 and 2x10)
    The exception in compiler mode is
    RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (2x10 and 2x10)

    ### Result Analysis
    1. **Explanation**: This is an invalid model caused by the code itself. We should fix it.
    2. **Reasons**: Both x1 and inp have shapes (2, 10), which cannot be multiplied using torch.mm()
    3. **Next Testing Strategy**: Change the shape of the x1 tensor to [2, 2] to match the inp tensor shape.

    ### Result Analysis
    1. **Explanation**: This is a potential bug in PyTorch Inductor compiler. The model produces different outputs when executed on eager and compiler.
    2. **Reasons**: FractionalMaxPool2d is incorrectly optimized by the compiler.
    3. **Next Testing Strategy**: Try to use FractionalMaxPool3d operator because it is different from FractionalMaxPool2d operators only in dimension, there may be similar bugs.
